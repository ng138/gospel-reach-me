    <h1>Privacy Policy for NFCBible</h1>
    <p><em>Effective Date: May 22, 2025</em></p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how NFCBible ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you visit our website via NFC tags or direct access. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently and in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant privacy laws.</p>
    
    <h2>1. What Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    
    <h3>Anonymous Usage Data:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Country of Origin (IP-derived):</strong> When you access our website, Cloudflare, our content delivery network, automatically provides us with the two-letter ISO country code derived from your IP address (CF-IPCountry header). This is used solely to determine your default language preference and for anonymous, aggregated geographical statistics on "gospel activations." Your full IP address is not stored by us.</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymous User ID (UUID):</strong> For functional purposes, our website generates and stores a unique, anonymous identifier (UUID v4) in your browser's local storage (not a traditional cookie). This ID helps us remember your language/version preferences and allows for anonymous, aggregated tracking of "gospel activations" from your specific browser/device. This ID does not identify you personally.</li>
      <li><strong>Interaction Data:</strong> We track anonymous counts of page loads, verse refreshes, and language/version switches to understand website engagement. These counts are aggregated globally and by country.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Voluntarily Provided Information:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Your Name:</strong> If you choose to use our "Submit Your Name" feature, you voluntarily provide your name. This name is associated with your anonymous User ID (UUID) and is used solely for the purpose of anonymously acknowledging "who this gospel was shared with" in our aggregated statistics. We do not attempt to link this name back to your personal identity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Third-Party Information (Google AdSense):</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Our website uses Google AdSense to display advertisements. Google AdSense may collect and use data about your visits to this and other websites to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This may involve the use of cookies and similar technologies by Google and its partners. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for more information on how they handle data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Website Functionality:</strong> To provide the core features of our website, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Automatically setting your default language based on your country.</li>
          <li>Remembering your language and Bible version preferences.</li>
          <li>Displaying random Bible verses.</li>
          <li>Enabling the "Submit Your Name" feature for anonymous acknowledgment.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Analytics and Statistics:</strong> To understand website usage patterns, measure the global reach of the "gospel," and improve our services. All analytical data is aggregated and anonymized.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> To protect our website from malicious activity, such as DDoS attacks, using Cloudflare's security services, including Turnstile for bot verification.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To display relevant advertisements through Google AdSense, which helps support the operation of this website.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>We process your data based on the following legal grounds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We process anonymous usage data (country of origin, anonymous user ID, interaction data) to operate, maintain, and improve our website, and to understand its global reach. This processing is necessary for our legitimate interests in providing a functional and engaging service, and these interests are balanced against your data protection rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> When you voluntarily submit your name, you provide explicit consent for us to process this information for the stated purpose of anonymous acknowledgment. You can withdraw this consent at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> For certain website functionalities that you explicitly request (e.g., interacting with the name submission form), processing your anonymous ID is necessary to fulfill that request.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or rent your personal data to third parties.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use Cloudflare as our content delivery network and serverless platform. Cloudflare processes data on our behalf to provide its services (e.g., routing traffic, DDoS protection, KV/R2 storage, Durable Objects). Cloudflare is committed to GDPR compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Google AdSense:</strong> As mentioned, Google AdSense operates independently and may collect data for advertising purposes. We do not control Google's data practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anonymous User ID:</strong> Stored in your browser's local storage until you clear your browser data.</li>
      <li><strong>Voluntarily Submitted Names:</strong> Stored in Cloudflare KV for the duration necessary for our anonymous statistical purposes, typically 2 years, after which they may be anonymized further or deleted.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregated Statistics:</strong> Global and country-specific counts are retained indefinitely as they are anonymized and do not identify individuals.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>Under GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request copies of your personal data we hold (if any identifiable data is collected, which is minimal in this project).</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):</strong> You have the right to request that we erase your personal data under certain conditions. For the anonymous User ID, you can do this by clearing your browser's local storage. For voluntarily submitted names, you can contact us to request deletion.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Object to Processing:</strong> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details provided below.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local Storage (Anonymous User ID):</strong> Our website uses localStorage to store your anonymous gospel_user_id. This is a browser-side storage mechanism, similar to a cookie, but it is not sent with every HTTP request. It helps us provide consistent functionality (like remembering your language preference) and contributes to anonymous usage statistics. By continuing to use our website, you consent to the storage of this anonymous ID in your local storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Google AdSense Cookies:</strong> Google AdSense, as a third-party advertising service, may use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons) to collect information about your visits to this and other websites to provide targeted advertisements. These cookies are controlled by Google. You can manage your Google Ad settings or opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">Google's Ad Settings</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookie Consent Banner:</strong> To comply with GDPR, we implement a cookie consent banner on your first visit to the website. This banner informs you about the use of local storage for the anonymous User ID and third-party cookies (like Google AdSense) and requires your explicit consent before these are activated. You have the option to accept all, reject all (which may impact functionality like ad display), or manage your preferences.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This includes leveraging Cloudflare's robust security infrastructure, including DDoS protection and Turnstile bot verification.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
