# Audio Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. TTS Service Module Created
- Created `src/services/ttsService.ts` with full Web Speech API support
- Supports all 5 languages (EN, ES, FR, DE, IT)
- Handles voice selection, rate, pitch, and volume
- Includes error handling and browser compatibility checks

### 2. FloatingAudioPlayer Enhanced
- Modified to support both pre-recorded audio AND Web Speech API
- Automatically falls back to Web Speech when audio files don't exist
- Maintains all existing UI features (play/pause, male/female toggle, volume)
- Shows appropriate status messages for Web Speech mode

### 3. Smart Fallback Logic
- First tries to load audio from `/tts-manifest.json`
- If manifest doesn't exist or verse audio not found, uses Web Speech API
- If browser doesn't support Web Speech, shows error message
- Seamless user experience - they just press play!

## üéâ How It Works Now

1. **User loads a verse** ‚Üí FloatingAudioPlayer appears at bottom
2. **User clicks play** ‚Üí 
   - If pre-recorded audio exists: Plays high-quality audio
   - If no audio files: Uses browser's text-to-speech
3. **Male/Female toggle** ‚Üí Works with both audio types (limited for Web Speech)
4. **All 5 languages supported** ‚Üí Automatic voice selection

## üìã Testing Instructions

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173
3. Notice the audio player at the bottom
4. Click play - it will use Web Speech API
5. Try switching languages - all should work
6. Try male/female toggle (effect depends on browser voices)

## üîú Future Enhancements

When ready to add pre-recorded audio:
1. Generate audio files using `scripts/generate_tts_audio.py`
2. Upload to Cloudflare R2
3. Deploy `tts-manifest.json`
4. FloatingAudioPlayer will automatically use the high-quality audio

## üí° Benefits of This Approach

- **Immediate value**: Audio works TODAY without generating files
- **No wasted work**: Existing AudioPlayer components fully utilized
- **Seamless upgrade**: When audio files are ready, no code changes needed
- **Graceful degradation**: Works on all modern browsers
- **Cost effective**: No storage costs until premium audio is ready

## üêõ Known Limitations

- Web Speech API voice quality varies by browser/OS
- Male/female voice selection limited by available system voices
- No progress bar or duration for Web Speech (technical limitation)
- Some browsers may require user interaction before first speech

## ‚ú® Summary

The audio feature is now fully functional! Users can listen to verses in all languages using their browser's built-in text-to-speech. When you're ready to provide premium audio quality, simply generate and deploy the audio files - the player will automatically upgrade to use them.
